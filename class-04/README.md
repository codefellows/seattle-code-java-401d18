# Class 4: Object-Oriented Programming, Domain Modeling, Command-Line Arguments, And Bitmaps

Today we're going to start diving into making Java objects. We'll do some domain modeling to figure out what data and behavior goes in them, and then we'll run our code from the command line to test it out.
